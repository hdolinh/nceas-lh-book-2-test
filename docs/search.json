    "text": "About this Course\nThis 5-day in-person workshop will provide researchers with an overview of reproducible and ethical research practices, steps and methods for more easily documenting and preserving their data at the Arctic Data Center, and an introduction to programming in R. Special attention will be paid to qualitative data management, including practices working with sensitive data. Example datasets will draw from natural and social sciences, and methods for conducting reproducible research will be discussed in the context of both qualitative and quantitative data. Responsible and reproducible data management practices will be discussed as they apply to all aspects of the data life cycle. This includes ethical data collection and data sharing, data sovereignty, and the CARE principles. The CARE principles are guidelines that help ensure open data practices (like the FAIR principles) appropriately engage with Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests."

This isn’t the end of that data’s life, though. These data can then be downloaded for different analyses or synthesis projects. In addition to being a data discovery portal, we also offer top-notch tools, support services, and training opportunities. We also provide data rescue services."

We will be using a special kind of RStudio just for servers called, aptly, RStudio Server. If you have never worked on a remove server before, you can think of it like working on a different computer via the internet. Note that the server has no knowledge of the files on your local filesystem, but it is easy to transfer files from the server to your local computer, and vice-versa, using the RStudio server interface.\nHere are the instructions for logging in and getting set up:"
