# R/RStudio and Git/GitHub Setup

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

-   How to check to make sure your RStudio environment is set up properly for analysis
-   How to set up git

## Logging into the RStudio server

Note that the server has no knowledge of the files on your local filesystem, but it is easy to transfer files from the server to your local computer, and vice-versa, using the RStudio server interface.
